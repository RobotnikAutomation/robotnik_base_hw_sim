# robotnik_base_hw_sim

This package is intended to simulate the Robotnik base hw common in most of the platforms

## 1. robotnik_base_hw_sim_node

### 1.1 Bringup

Run the following launch inside the desired namespace.

**Arguments**

* prefix: prefix for the default joints (for multirobots envs)
* config_yaml: default config yaml. Every robot should have one.

For RB2:
```
roslaunch robotnik_base_hw_sim rb2_hw_sim.launch prefix:=rb2_a config_yaml:=rb2
```

For SummitXLS
```
roslaunch robotnik_base_hw_sim summit_xl_hw_sim.launch prefix:=summit_xl_a config_yaml:=summit_xls
```

## 2. robotnik_elevator_controller plugin

Plugin to simulate the Elevator interface available in some robots.

It requires a transmission of **<hardwareInterface>hardware_interface/EffortJointInterface</hardwareInterface>**.

Example of control configuration:

```
  robotnik_elevator_controller:
    type        : "robotnik_elevator_controller/RobotnikElevatorController"
    joint:    
      elevator_joint:
        name: rb2_a_elevator_platform_joint
    elevator_position_up: 0.05
    elevator_position_down: 0.0
    # delay time to perform the elevation
    elevation_action_time: 1.0
    # params for the pickup avoiding Gazebo physics (see elevator_fake_pickup_gazebo)
    gazebo:
      # if true, the carts will be raised avoiding contact
      disable_gazebo_physics_for_pickup: true
      pickup_service: "/elevator_fake_pickup_gazebo/simple_pick"
      place_service: "/elevator_fake_pickup_gazebo/simple_place"
      # model id used in Gazebo
      robot_model: "rb2_a"
      # distance in z to move the picked cart
      elevation_offset_z: 0.07  
```

## 3. elevator_fake_pickup_gazebo node

ROS node to perform pick and place of object avoiding the physics. It uses the available gazebo ROS topics and services.
It is intended to pick & place carts/trolleys with a mobile base.

The way it works:

1. Pick: removes gravity of the object to pick
2. Sets the position of the object in the same one than the robot. This is done continuosly.
3. Place: sets the gravity of the picked object and stops setting the position of the robot

### 3.1 bringup
